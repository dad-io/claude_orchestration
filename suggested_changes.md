# Suggested Changes and Improvements

This document outlines potential improvements to enhance the Claude Code orchestration system based on analysis of the current architecture and integration patterns.

## Immediate Improvements

**Status**: **COMPLETED** - Implementation available in `commands/orchestrate-list.md`

**Implemented Features**:
- ✅ `orchestrate list` - Shows all available templates with descriptions and use cases
- ✅ `orchestrate list [template]` - Detailed view of specific templates
- ✅ `orchestrate help <template_name>` - Comprehensive template documentation
- ✅ `orchestrate recommend` - AI-powered template recommendations based on project analysis
- ✅ Interactive template discovery with examples and use cases
- ✅ Project structure analysis for intelligent recommendations

```bash
# Available commands
orchestrate list                    # List all templates with descriptions
orchestrate list build              # Detailed build template information
orchestrate help fix                # Comprehensive fix template documentation
orchestrate recommend               # AI recommendations based on project analysis
```

### 2. Workflow Resume Enhancement ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Problem**: While checkpoints exist, there's no clear way to resume interrupted workflows.

**Status**: **COMPLETED** - Implementation available in `commands/orchestrate-resume.md`

**Implemented Features**:
- ✅ `orchestrate resume` - Interactive selection of workflows to resume with progress tracking
- ✅ `orchestrate resume <workflow_id>` - Resume specific workflows from checkpoints
- ✅ `orchestrate status` - Comprehensive dashboard of all workflow states
- ✅ Multiple resume modes (standard, fast, safe, rollback)
- ✅ Robust error recovery and state validation
- ✅ Automatic resume prompts for interrupted workflows
- ✅ Checkpoint integrity verification and rollback capabilities

```bash
# Available commands
orchestrate resume                  # Interactive workflow selection with progress
orchestrate resume workflow-abc123  # Resume specific workflow from checkpoint
orchestrate status                  # Dashboard of all active/interrupted workflows
orchestrate resume --safe          # Conservative resume with extra validation
orchestrate resume --rollback      # Resume from earlier checkpoint
```

### 3. Agent Performance Monitoring ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Problem**: Limited visibility into agent performance and bottlenecks.

**Status**: **COMPLETED** - Implementation available in `commands/orchestrate-monitor.md`

**Implemented Features**:
- ✅ `orchestrate monitor` - Real-time performance dashboard with live agent metrics

- ✅ Historical performance tracking and custom dashboards
- ✅ Predictive analysis and capacity planning
- ✅ Agent communication matrix and workflow pattern analysis

```bash
# Available commands
orchestrate monitor                 # Real-time dashboard with all agent metrics
orchestrate monitor builder-python # Detailed Python builder performance analysis
orchestrate monitor system         # System-wide performance and resource utilization
orchestrate monitor alerts         # Current alerts and threshold management
orchestrate monitor history 24h    # Historical performance analysis
```

### 4. Template Customization Framework

**Problem**: Templates are static and may not fit all project needs.

**Suggestions**:
- Allow template parameter customization
- Support template inheritance and composition
- Enable project-specific template overrides

```yaml
# Example: custom template inheritance
name: "custom-build"
inherits: "build.yaml"
overrides:
  phases:
    implementation:
      parallel_limit: 8
      custom_agents: ["performance-specialist"]
```

## Architecture Enhancements

**Current State**: Hooks provide basic lifecycle management

**Improvements**:
- Add more granular hook points (before/after each agent task)
- Support conditional hook execution based on workflow context
- Enable hook chaining and composition

### 2. External Tool Integration

**Current State**: Limited integration with external development tools

**Improvements**:
- Integration with popular IDEs (VS Code, IntelliJ)
- Support for external CI/CD systems
- Integration with project management tools (Jira, GitHub Issues)

### 3. Configuration Management

**Current State**: Configuration is scattered across multiple files

**Improvements**:
- Centralized configuration management
- Environment-specific configurations
- Runtime configuration updates

```yaml
# Proposed: .claude/config.yaml
orchestrator:
  parallel_limit: 6
  checkpoint_frequency: 300  # seconds
  agent_timeout: 30  # seconds

templates:
  default_timeout: 3600
